# Game Server Management Lab

## 📝 Project Overview
This project documents my experience managing and customizing a multiplayer game server environment. It served as a hands-on lab to apply core skills in system administration, scripting, Java programming, security, and network tools.

I independently set up and maintained the server, implemented plugin modifications in Java, and applied performance and security optimizations to simulate a production environment.
